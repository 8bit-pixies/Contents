Chapman's implementation of [Janko's Table of Contents using Jquery](http://www.jankoatwarpspeed.com/post/2009/08/20/Table-of-contents-using-jQuery.aspx). 

Differences:
*	Changed the layout slightly to accommodate 'responsive web' using [skeleton](http://www.getskeleton.com/)
*	Navigation is not fixed. This is due to the default `*.css` files which are used in skeleton. This could be changed so that navigaation is fixed for certain resolutions. (see that on the [getskeleton](http://www.getskeleton.com/) website, the navigation on the left is fixed.
